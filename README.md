#  SwiftUI AdaptiveSheet

## Description

A simple implementation of a modal sheet in SwiftUI that adapts its size to its content.

It is rough, and there are edge cases in which it doesn't work particularly well (like, e.g. when the content is taller than or nearly like the height of the screen). 

Code should be quite self explaining, but feel free to send a message or open an issue if you have any question.

Feel free to use, modify, or improve the code. If you come up with improvements, please open a PR, thanks!
